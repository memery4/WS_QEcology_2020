<center><h1> The drivers that effect the water transparency of Lake Annie, FL </h1></center>

# Introduction
Water transparency is influence by the physical, chemical and biological factors of the lake. For example a study of a shallow lake showed that the decrease of water transparency was caused by the wind which resuspend the bottom lake’s sediment into the water column, resulting in a brown water coloration (Fulton et al. 2015). Another research did a full lake experiment and showed that increase in the phosphorus levels in the nutrient content instigated a phytoplankton bloom which caused the water transparency to decrease and the water color became green (Schindler 1974).  As the water transparency decreases less visible light is able to penetrate the surface water resulting in a decrease in thermocline depth and a decrease the heating rates of deeper water (Gaiser et al. 2009a). By monitoring a lake’s water transparency one can understand the factors that changes the lake’s ecosystem. 

## Previous Research on Lake Annie, Florida
An interesting pattern of water transparency was seen in a long-term record of a tropical lake, Lake Annie, in Florida. Lake Annie’s yearly average water transparency has an oscillation pattern and the water coloration cycles between clear and dark brown every 30 years (Gaiser et al. 2009b). The continuous data from 2000 to 2008 was used to determine the potential drivers of water transparency, which this study looked at was chlorophyll a, nutrients (total nitrogen and total phosphorus), water color and groundwater level (Gaiser et al. 2009a). They found that the change in water transparency of Lake Annie was primarily caused by the water color, which was from dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and not chlorophyll a or nutrients (Gaiser et al. 2009a). Even with minimal data DOC from 1994-2008, the DOC and ground water level were significant factors that influenced the water transparency of Lake Annie (Gaiser et al. 2009a).

## Goals of this project
For my project I would like to continue looking at the drivers of Lake Annie’s water transparency by using the continuous monthly limnological data from 2006 to 2018 to verify the similar findings of prior research. My goal is to use autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model to analyze the water transparency data and to determine which explanatory variable (chlorophyll a, nitrogen, phosphorus, ground water level or dissolve organic carbon) will result in a better fit model of water transparency. By using a ARIMA model will allow me to understand the lags between each time periods and between the water transparency and the explanatory variables. 


## Methods

### Site Information 
Lake Annie is a small tropical lake (37ha) that is part of Archbold Biological Field Station since 1983 and is located northwest from Lake Okeechobee in Florida (Figure 1. Left photo). Since this lake is protected by the biological field station, it experiences minimal effect from human activity. One potential human effect to Lake Annie is from the neighboring farmlands (Figure 1. Right photo). However, Lake Annie is classified as an oligotrophic lake and is currently not experiencing an enrichment from nutrients. Lake Annie has the maximum depth of 21 meters and experience one turnover period (also known as monomictic).

### Data Collection/ Data Set
Archbold Biological Field Station provided the environmental data (secchi depth, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), chlorophyll a, and ground water stage). These measurements were taken monthly from 2006-2018. Secchi depth was determined by using a secchi disc to measure the penetration of visible light in the water column. Dissolve organic carbon total phosphorus, total nitrogen and chlorophyll a was determined by taking a water sample and processing the samples in the lab. Ground water stage was determined by measuring the water table above the mean sea level. 


### Statistical Analysis

**Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)** was used to analyze this time series data. The benefit in using the ARIMA model is that the legacy effect within the data, like autocorrelation or seasonality, is capture because the ARIMA models uses the past data or explanatory variables to determine the best model. The time series data must follow two assumption in order to use the ARIMA model. First, the time series data must be stationary, which means that the data must have a constant variance and mean. The augment Dicky-Fuller is a statistical test for stationarity. In addition, the autocorrelation plots, autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation function (PACF), was also used to determine if the data follow stationarity. Secondly the ARIMA residuals must be independent for each interval and the Ljung-Box statistical test was used to test for independence. 

Three ARIMA models were compared to determine which explanatory variable (dissolved organic carbon (DOC), chlorophyll a, or ground water stage) drives the change in water transparency base on secchi depth data. The Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) values was compared between the three models and the best model was determined by the lowest AIC value.
